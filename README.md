From an older github account that I lost access to
# TikTokEmailLike

So someone this morning tried to get me into some money laundering scam. I was not a fan of this. So I wrote this code today to email the scammer a Rick Roll link for every like a TikTok video gets. This code does not have all of the credentials for my accounts but does work if you fill in credentials of your own.

The only things that would need to change is the value of i and i1. I set them at 2599990 because I was testing on Gordon Ramsey TikTok and I had to make sure all of it worked. This code is still a work in progress but it is 95% done. All that would need to change is setting those values to 0 and making it so that the program runs once an hour by itself or maybe once evvery half an hour. This code will be finished either a little bit later today or early tommorrow. 

I also want to add a feature (that's nearly finished) where it also sends a text message to a scammer if you have their phone number.
